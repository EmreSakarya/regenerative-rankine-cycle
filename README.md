## ⚡ Project Overview

This project analyzes a **Regenerative Rankine Cycle** that includes both an Open Feedwater Heater (OFWH) and a Reheat stage. The simulation uses the **IAPWS-97** steam tables (via `pyXSteam`) to calculate thermodynamic properties with high precision.

The study is divided into two parts:
1.  **Part A:** Investigating the effect of **Turbine Inlet Temperature** ($300^\circ C - 600^\circ C$) on thermal efficiency and steam quality.
2.  **Part B:** Investigating the effect of **Reheat Temperature** ($300^\circ C - 400^\circ C$) while keeping the inlet temperature fixed at $500^\circ C$.

### ⚙️ System Parameters
* **Boiler Pressure:** 70 bar
* **OFWH Pressure:** 8 bar
* **Condenser Pressure:** 0.1 bar
* **Turbine/Pump Efficiency:** 90%

## 📊 Results Summary

The code calculates the thermal efficiency and exit steam quality for varying temperature inputs.

**Part A Results (Variable Inlet Temp):**
Increasing the turbine inlet temperature improves thermal efficiency but may decrease the steam quality at the turbine exit.

**Part B Results (Variable Reheat Temp):**
Applying reheat improves both the cycle efficiency and the steam quality, protecting turbine blades from erosion.

*(Full data tables are generated by running the script.)*
